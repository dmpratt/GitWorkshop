These are my notes, saved securely in Git!

1.	I want to teach the --amend option in a commit.  This is amazing because I am constantly forgetting something and committing too early!
2.	git reset (Dangerious? sometimes. misunderstood? often)
3.	Fetch and Push vs Pull.  Fetch only updates your local branch where pull will include merging changes into your working directory too.
4.  Mention entire dev team attacked and eaten by wolves on the same night!  HA!
5.	reflog great for restoring accidental branch deletes
6.	HEAD~ or HEAD~2
7.	See what's in a branch and not in another do git log master..topic  It's all in the ..  What's in topic that's not in master.  
8.	Stash!  No need to apply to the same branch.  Silly TFS.
9,	git clean - remove all untracked junk.  Be Careful!  Does not remove ignored files, just stuff you didn't want.  -d removes empty dirs too  -n to test
10.	git grep
11. git rebase -i HEAD~3  Be so careful
12. When merging.  Stash or checkin first.  May want to mess with the merge.
